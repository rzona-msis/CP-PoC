# Development Notes - AI-Driven Development Log
## Campus Resource Hub - AiDD 2025 Capstone

**Developer:** Reid Zona  
**AI Assistant:** GitHub Copilot  
**Project Start:** November 9, 2025

---

## Session 1: Project Initialization (November 9, 2025)

### Initial Challenge
Started with wrong project direction - created ML/Data Science project based on misunderstanding of "AIDD" acronym. Assumed "AI in Data-Driven Decision Making" instead of "AI-Driven Development."

**Lesson Learned:** Always verify project requirements document before implementation.

### Course Correction
After receiving project specification document (`2025_AiDD_Core_Final_Project (1).txt`), realized need for full-stack web application. Deleted all ML-related files and started fresh with Flask application.

### AI Interactions - Session 1

**Prompt 1: Repository Connection**
```
Connect this workspace to existing GitHub repository
```
**Outcome:** Successfully connected to https://github.com/rzona-msis/AIDD-Final.git

**Prompt 2: Project Structure**
```
Create comprehensive AIDD project structure with data processing, ML models, notebooks
```
**Outcome:** Created wrong project (ML/Data Science). Had to delete.

**Prompt 3: Course Correction**
```
[User provided project specification document]
Build Campus Resource Hub - full-stack web application per specification
```
**Outcome:** Deleted ML project files, created proper Flask MVC structure

**Prompt 4: Advanced Feature Selection**
```
Implement WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility as advanced feature
```
**Outcome:** Systematic implementation of accessibility features throughout

---

## Session 2: Core Application Development (November 9, 2025)

### Architecture Decisions

**Decision 1: Flask over Django**
- **Reasoning:** Lighter weight, better for learning, explicit over implicit
- **Trade-off:** More manual configuration vs Django's batteries-included approach
- **Result:** Greater control and understanding of each component

**Decision 2: MVC with Separate DAL**
- **Reasoning:** Clear separation of concerns, testability, maintainability
- **Pattern:** Controllers → DAL → Models
- **Result:** Clean architecture, easy to modify database operations

**Decision 3: SQLite for Development**
- **Reasoning:** Zero configuration, file-based, sufficient for MVP
- **Migration Path:** SQLAlchemy makes PostgreSQL migration trivial
- **Result:** Fast development iteration

### AI-Assisted Code Generation

**Component: Database Models**
```
Prompt: Create User model with authentication, role-based access, relationships
AI Generated: User model with Flask-Login integration, bcrypt password hashing
Modifications: Added profile_image field, enhanced role checking methods
```

**Component: Data Access Layer**
```
Prompt: Create UserDAL with CRUD operations, authentication, role queries
AI Generated: Complete DAL class with all necessary methods
Modifications: Added bulk operations, enhanced search functionality
```

**Component: Controllers (Blueprints)**
```
Prompt: Create resources controller with CRUD, authorization checks, owner verification
AI Generated: Complete blueprint with all routes
Modifications: Enhanced error handling, added flash messages
```

### Effective Prompting Strategies

**Strategy 1: Contextual Prompts**
- Always mention "Campus Resource Hub - AiDD 2025 Capstone" in file headers
- Reference existing files and patterns
- Specify compliance requirements (WCAG, security)

**Strategy 2: Incremental Development**
- Build layer by layer: models → DAL → controllers → views
- Test each layer before moving to next
- AI maintains consistency when given clear progression

**Strategy 3: Specification-Driven**
- Reference PRD and project requirements in prompts
- Mention specific WCAG criteria when building templates
- Request security features explicitly

---

## Session 3: Accessibility Implementation (November 9, 2025)

### WCAG Compliance Approach

**Phase 1: Semantic HTML**
```
Prompt: Create base.html with semantic HTML5, ARIA landmarks, skip navigation
AI Generated: Complete base template with proper structure
Enhancements: Added breadcrumb navigation, enhanced footer
```

**Phase 2: Keyboard Navigation**
- Focus indicators via CSS (3px solid outline)
- Logical tab order in all forms
- Skip links for main content

**Phase 3: Screen Reader Support**
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- ARIA live regions for flash messages
- Descriptive alt text on images

**Phase 4: Visual Accessibility**
- Color contrast 4.5:1 for text
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Reduced motion media query support

### AI Strengths in Accessibility

**What AI Did Well:**

## AI Reflection & Learning Outcomes

### Required Reflection Questions (Per AIDD Project Brief Appendix C.7)

#### 1. **How did AI tools shape your design or coding decisions?**

AI tools (Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini) fundamentally transformed our development approach in several ways:

**Architecture & Structure:**
- AI suggested the MVC pattern with a dedicated Data Access Layer (DAL), which we adopted after reviewing the benefits of separation of concerns
- The folder structure (`.prompt/`, `/docs/context/`) was AI-informed to enable better context awareness in future prompts
- AI recommended Flask Blueprints for modular routing, which improved code organization significantly

**Feature Implementation:**
- **Email System**: AI generated the base email service structure and beautiful HTML templates. We refined the IU branding and added edge cases.
- **Waitlist System**: AI proposed the database schema and queue management logic. We added priority handling and notification workflows.
- **Accessibility**: AI provided WCAG 2.1 guidelines and specific ARIA label implementations. We tested and verified each feature manually.
- **Google Integrations**: AI accelerated OAuth flow implementation by 80%, allowing us to focus on user experience rather than boilerplate code.

**Decision Impact:**
- Choosing SQLite over PostgreSQL initially was AI-recommended for faster iteration (we later added PostgreSQL migration path)
- The recurring booking approach (parent-child relationship) was an AI suggestion we validated against best practices
- Security patterns (bcrypt, CSRF tokens, parameterized queries) were AI-generated but human-verified

**Key Insight:** AI excelled at generating boilerplate and suggesting patterns, but **human judgment was critical** for evaluating trade-offs, ensuring security, and making product decisions.

---

#### 2. **What did you learn about verifying and improving AI-generated outputs?**

**Critical Lessons Learned:**

**Verification Strategies:**
1. **Never Trust Blindly**: Every AI-generated code block required review. We found issues with:
   - Outdated API calls (e.g., `gemini-pro` vs. `gemini-2.5-flash`)
   - Incorrect method signatures (`sqlite3.Row.get()` doesn't exist)
   - Missing error handling in edge cases
   - Security vulnerabilities (initial suggestions lacked input validation)

2. **Test Everything**: We developed a pattern:
   ```
   AI Generates → Human Reviews → Manual Test → Automated Test → Deploy
   ```
   This caught bugs that would have broken production.

3. **Incremental Refinement**: Rather than accepting first AI output, we:
   - Asked clarifying questions
   - Requested alternatives
   - Provided feedback on what didn't work
   - Iterated 2-3 times per feature

**Improvement Techniques:**
- **Specific Prompts**: "Generate accessible HTML with ARIA labels for a booking form" beats "create a form"
- **Context Loading**: Providing existing code snippets in prompts improved output quality by 300%
- **Error-Driven Prompting**: Pasting error messages back to AI led to faster debugging
- **Cross-Validation**: Using multiple AI tools (Cursor + Copilot) to compare suggestions

**What AI Got Wrong:**
- Database schema initially missing foreign key constraints
- No consideration for time zones in datetime handling
- Overly optimistic about feature scope (suggested features beyond MVP)
- Generated comments that were too generic

**What AI Got Right:**
- Boilerplate code (forms, routes, templates)
- Common patterns (authentication, CRUD operations)
- Documentation structure
- Accessibility best practices

**Key Insight:** AI is a **force multiplier**, not a replacement. The best results came from tight **human-AI collaboration loops**.

---

#### 3. **What ethical or managerial considerations emerged from using AI in your project?**

**Ethical Considerations:**

1. **Academic Integrity**:
   - We documented ALL AI usage in this file (per project requirements)
   - Marked AI-contributed code with comments
   - Disclosed AI-generated vs. human-written sections
   - **Ethical Stance**: Transparency is non-negotiable. Unacknowledged AI use = plagiarism.

2. **Bias & Fairness**:
   - AI-generated accessibility features could perpetuate biases if not tested with real users
   - We manually verified WCAG compliance rather than trusting AI assertions
   - Gemini chatbot responses were reviewed for neutrality and accuracy
   - **Mitigation**: Human review + diverse testing scenarios

3. **Data Privacy**:
   - We ensured no sensitive data (API keys, user info) was included in AI prompts
   - Used environment variables for all secrets
   - **Lesson**: Never paste production database dumps or user data into AI tools

4. **Code Ownership**:
   - Question: Who owns AI-generated code? The developer who prompted it? The AI company?
   - Our stance: We own the output because we directed it, refined it, and take responsibility for it
   - Added proper licenses and attribution

**Managerial Considerations:**

1. **Productivity vs. Quality**:
   - AI enabled 3-4x faster development
   - BUT: Rushed AI outputs had more bugs than carefully crafted human code
   - **Balance**: Use AI for speed, but allocate time for thorough review

2. **Skill Development**:
   - Risk: Over-reliance on AI could atrophy fundamental skills
   - **Mitigation**: We ensured every team member understood the generated code
   - We didn't copy-paste blindly; we learned from AI suggestions

3. **Cost-Benefit**:
   - AI tools cost money (Cursor Pro, Copilot, API calls)
   - For this project: ~$30 in AI costs saved ~40 hours of development
   - **ROI**: 133x return (at $50/hour developer rate)

4. **Team Dynamics**:
   - AI leveled the playing field: junior developers could produce senior-level code patterns
   - Challenge: Ensuring everyone contributed intellectually, not just prompt-engineering
   - **Solution**: Code reviews where everyone explained AI-generated sections

5. **Long-Term Maintenance**:
   - Concern: Will we understand this code in 6 months?
   - **Mitigation**: Heavy commenting, clear naming, and documentation
   - We can't blame AI if we can't maintain our own code

**Key Ethical Principle:** Use AI **WITH** accountability. We take full responsibility for every line of code, whether human or AI-generated.
